    "## Student Performance Linear Regression Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, I’m working on a project using **Linear Regression** with the **Student Performance** dataset from Kaggle.  \n",
    "My goal is to analyze the factors that influence students’ academic performance and build a model that predicts the **Performance Index** based on variables such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Study Hours**\n",
    "- **Previous Scores**\n",
    "- **Extracurricular Activities**\n",
    "- **Sleep Hours**\n",
    "- **Sample Question Papers Practiced**\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a clean and efficient workflow, I am also using **scikit-learn Pipelines**.  \n",
    "With pipelines, I can streamline preprocessing steps—such as encoding categorical features, scaling numeric variables, and feeding the processed data directly into the regression model—making the entire process more organized, reproducible, and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to explore the relationships between these features and develop a regression pipeline that provides meaningful insights into student performance.\n"
